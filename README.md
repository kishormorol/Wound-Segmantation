# Wound-Segmantation
This research aims to develop and optimize deep learning models specifically tailored for wound segmentation, addressing issues related to variations in wound types, sizes, and imaging conditions. The investigation will involve the integration of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other models.
